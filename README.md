### ABOUT ###
A Magical Journey Through a Procedurally Generated Forest is a project we have created for our class Comp 371 - Computer Graphics.
As the name of the project states, the world is procedurally generated on each run. The maple/pine trees, bushes, rocks, terrain, clouds, and fireflies are randomly generated and placed on the world based on specific parameters such as base height and size.

This project was created using OpenGL 3.3 profile core.


### Controls ###
The project includes a camera which may be used to freely roam the generated terrain, however there are no collision detection for the world objects.
The terrain does not generate beyond the initial creation but it is a feature that we would like to implement if we had more time.

Camera Movement: 
 * Press 'W' : Move Camera forward
 * Press 'A' : Move Camera to the left
 * Press 'S' : Move Camera downward
 * Press 'D' : Move Camera to the right

 * Press 'SPACE'        : Ascend the camera 
 * Press 'LEFT CONTROL' : Descend the camera 

 * Press 'Left Shift' : Doubles camera movement speed
 * Press 'C'          : Slow down camera movement speed by half
